# Reflect 2

Final project made for ICS4UI back in 2021.

## Description

Taken from `reflect2.pde`:

A (more or less) deterministic light and mirror simulator. Version 2.

* Left click + drag to add a light beam.
* Right click + drag to add a mirror.
* Click + drag a mirror endpoint to move that vertex.
* Click + drag anywhere else on the mirror to move the entire mirror.
* Right click a mirror to cycle it's side type.
* Control click a mirror to remove it.

Mirrors have two sides which can have one of three behaviours:
* transparent: lets light through
* reflective: bounces light back
* opaque: absorbs the light
